For this assignment I am using my readme as a planner and outline.

## Summary

Everyone wants to accomplish several different things at once and better themselves in either health, knowledge, or courage. My adventure story is going to be filled with sadistic humor. It will give you a path for each choice and give you another consequence that ultimately happens after fulfilling one desire.

### Example

You chose health: Now that you've spent all of your time hanging out at the gym you ultimately have no friends or normal humans to relate to. But your bod looks great!

You chose knowledge: You can now speak three languages and have a beautiful grasp on the worlds history of colonization. During your many hours at the library and rosetta stone three years has gone by. You have abandoned your spouse in the process of studying, lost many chances to travel and your only opportunities ahead are to teach what you have spent years learning. Good luck.

You chose courage: You're adventurous spirit brought you to a back ally restaurant in Honk Hong where you tried a mysterious soup. This soup caused severe food poisoning and dysentery. Unable to get proper care in the Chinese hospital you perished in an abandoned parking lot the next day.
