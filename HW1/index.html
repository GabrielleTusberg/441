      <div class="box green"><h1 id="more_info">Why Media Arts?</h1><p>This is a question I ask myself since this became my focus in college. My interests range through many subjects but I had to chose something I had already spent most of my time doing. I wanted the security of knowing my major was something I had enjoyed in the past. Art had been a big part of my upbringing and I always felt like I had a creative personality. I gained my interest of art and design through my parents. Watching them make succesful careers out of something many people discounted as a way of making a living was inspiring. I was eager to do the same. However, once actually beginning I realized it was not nearly as easy as I anticipated. Being creative on the spot can be overwhelming it is difficult not to compare early work to what the pros are up to these days. Unfortuantely for the voice in my head that sometimes says 'quit' I enjoy this too much to allow myself the pleasure.
