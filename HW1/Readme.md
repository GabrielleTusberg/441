# Homework 1
## MART 441

### Objective
  I wanted to go off of my layout from the last RWD design in the 341 class. Since it had been awhile I needed a refresher. As I began ideas of how the layout wanted to be for this site changed. I wanted two quotes to separate the content in the boxes and I wanted to quotes to be pronounced in the website styles I had seen before.

#### Struggles
  I didn't perfect the quotes in how I wanted them to look. Also the layout didn't turn out exactly how I wanted. At certain break points the boxes get a little funky.

#### What I Got Out of This Assignment
* Patience
* A great refresher
* Confidence

I really enjoy web design I think its much more suitable for me than java or p5. I feel like I have more freedom to be more creative. This ultimately helps with my patience because I want to persevere to see the best possible outcome.
