### This Week
  I got very behind with my classes this week so I was a bit worried I was going to have to make an entire web page tonight. I was a bit confused on that end for a moment as well. I am happy that it's off to a slower pace for this week with just knowing what we will be expecting with using these three languages together.

#### What I Got Out of This Assignment
* Excitement
* Nervousness
* Confidence
