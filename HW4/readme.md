I was happy to have more practice with problem solving. The first problem I figured out pretty quickly. With the problems that followed after that they got more and more tricky. With the last two I looked up my classmates work to see what they did after struggling for sometime. I was pretty close with those two but was ultimately just making it more complicated then it needed to be.
