# HW-3 Readme for Gabrielle Tusberg

It's helpful for me to work on small problems like this in code to really understand the fundamentals of how it works. I am happy that we will be continuing this for next weeks assignment since I do still feel like I need more practice. I enjoy starting over this way because the product of what I am trying to do is a smaller function. When I have to make more of an art piece I get overwhelmed and have difficulty doing it step by step.
